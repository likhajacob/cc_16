Scenario: A small e-commerce business wants a simple Product Dashboard that displays product listings from an online data source. Each product should show its name, price, and image. The dashboard will fetch data from an external API and display it dynamically on the page. The business wants the dashboard to be built using standard web technologies without any frameworks.
